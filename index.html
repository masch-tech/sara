  <h2>About My Apology</h2>
  <p>

Sara,
I never meant to hurt you. I just didn‚Äôt know how to handle things, and I was afraid ‚Äî afraid of losing something so real. You were always good to me, in ways I never deserved, and I wish I had shown you that more.

I‚Äôve realized that your love was always true, always greater than mine. Do you remember when we used to argue about whose love was stronger? Yours was ‚Äî a hundred percent. Your love was so real, and thank you for loving me. I‚Äôm so grateful that I was loved by someone like you.

I wish I had shown you more, even when I felt I wasn‚Äôt enough or good for you. I miss you ‚Äî your warmth, your love, and the peace I felt when you were okay.

It‚Äôs been four months now, and I‚Äôve never moved on. They‚Äôve been the hardest four months of my life. A lot has happened, and I know I can‚Äôt make excuses ‚Äî not my phone, not my situation, nothing. I know what I did. I hope one day you can forgive me.

I made this website not to ask for anything, but just to show you how sorry I am ‚Äî even though I know this can‚Äôt compare to what I did. I started learning how to build websites to distract myself, to stop thinking, but everything still led back to you.

So, Sarah, I just want to say ‚Äî I‚Äôm truly, deeply sorry.
I hope life brings you all the love you once gave me. Your love was real. I hope you find someone with a heart like yours ‚Äî someone who will love you the way you deserve.
</p>

  <h2>My Letter to You</h2>
  <p>
   Even after the silence, I still think of you with care.
You appear in every soft song, in every quiet night, and in every thought that reminds me what kindness feels like.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs strange how memories stay ‚Äî how your laugh echoes in moments I don‚Äôt expect, or how your name still feels warm when I whisper it inside my mind.

I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for either of us, but I know I‚Äôm grateful ‚Äî grateful that our paths crossed, that I got to know someone as real and gentle as you.

No matter where life takes you, I hope you find peace, happiness, and someone who sees you the way I once did ‚Äî and even more.
